# Kernel-Module-Develoepment-Environment-with-Riscv-Qemu-Emulatation-Running-on-Fedora-Linux
This repository explains step by step how to emulate a development environment with a different instruction architecture than the host machine. This emulation is done with Qemu emulation software. Implementation of a kernel module development environment setup, various configurations and commands are described. 

As a prerequisite, the person who reads this repository should be familiar with operating systems fundamentals and especially the basic theory of kernel modules. The Qemu will be using Fedora distribution of linux.

For better performance and compatibility as a host machine we advise using the Ubuntu version of Linux to create the development environment.

The necessary commands for Fedora environment is given in the Running Riscv on Qemu readme file. 

For the kernel module development of a custom crypto core SHA256, check out my other repository on this link https://github.com/firatkagitci/Kernel-Module-Development-for-RISC-V-Architecture-with-Buildroot-Linux-
